Species/genera per family	(relationship with worldwide trend of family richness)


## Geography related questions
Species per district and levels of diversity coverage per district or how well studied are the various districts in Greece with respect to spiders?
Chorological analysis 

Special issues:
Caves?
Islands
High mountains (e.g. elevations above 1000 m a.s.l.)

Conservation issues:
